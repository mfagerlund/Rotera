=== Optimization Logs ===
[Optimize] WP:14 L:20 VP:1 IP:14 C:5
[validateVanishingPoints] Added 18 virtual VP lines from direction-constrained Lines
[Init Debug] uninitCameras=1, lockedPts=1, canVP=true
[validateVanishingPoints] Added 18 virtual VP lines from direction-constrained Lines
[Init Path] skipVPForLatePnP=true (uninit=1, locked=1, hasVL=false)
[Init Debug] No cameras initialized. uninitCameras=1, canUseLatePnP=true
[Init Debug] Single camera will use late PnP with constrained points
[Align] y-axis: dot=-1.00 -> -
[Align] y-axis: chose -Y
[Fix] Camera 1 at locked point O - moved back
  Centroid of 14 constrained points: [2.776, 15.597, 3.823]
  Sample constrained points (first 5):
    [5.000, 20.000, 0.000]
    [5.000, 0.000, 0.000]

    [0.000, 0.000, 5.000]
  Max distance from centroid: 19.565
  Computed camera distance: 48.913
  Initial camera position: [2.776, 15.597, -45.090]
PnP: Initialized 1 using 14 constrained points
  Initial reprojection error: 726.70 px
  Final reprojection error: 0.00 px (9 iterations)
  Position: [34.476, 22.784, -11.813]
  Final distance from centroid: 36.069 (ratio to initial: 0.74x)
[Init] 1 via late PnP
[Solve] conv=true, iter=138, median=0.40px | 1:f=3126
[Handedness] Result is LEFT-HANDED (no locked coords to determine axis), applying Z-flip
[AxisFlips] Applying flips: X=false, Y=false, Z=true (1 total)
[AxisFlips] Odd number of flips - will set isZReflected=true
[AxisFlips] Camera 1: position and rotation transformed, isZReflected=true
[Summary] ** Good | error=1.614 | median=0.40px | iter=138 | conv=true | 3105ms
