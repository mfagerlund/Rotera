# Rotera Project Definition

## Goal

**Help others reconstruct 3D geometry from 2D photos** - filling the gap between limited tools like fSpy (single-image, basic) and full photogrammetry suites (complex, different problem space).

Rotera offers constraint-based reconstruction for VFX artists, architects, and hobbyists who need accurate 3D from a few photos.

## What is Good Enough

- Works reliably for real-world use cases (not just demos)
- Polished UI - no rough edges, graceful error handling, professional feel
- Feature-complete for its niche: multi-image, vanishing lines, distance/angle constraints, Blender export
- Self-explanatory enough that users don't need to ask the author for help

## Done

**When it has a life of its own:**

- Users are actively using it
- Documentation is complete enough for self-service
- Open for community contributions (clear contribution guidelines, maintainable codebase)
- Can be maintained without constant author involvement

## Reality Check

A tutorial video would significantly lower the barrier to entry. Options:
- Create a basic "here's how it works" video (doesn't need to be polished)
- Reach out to Blender content creators once a rough video exists
- Interactive in-app tutorial (more work, but no video needed)

The goal is to ship something usable, not perfect. A working tool with basic docs beats a polished tool that never ships.
