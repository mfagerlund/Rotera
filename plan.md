# Key Specifications (Appendix)

## Parameterization

* **Camera intrinsics K:** `(fx, fy, cx, cy, k1[, k2])`, no skew initially.
* **Camera pose:** `R ∈ SO(3)` (axis-angle 3-vec), `t ∈ ℝ³`.
* **WP:** `X ∈ ℝ³`.

## Residuals (units)

* **Reprojection:** `r = (û−u, v̂−v)` \[pixels], robust loss.
* **KnownCoord:** masked difference \[m].
* **Distance:** `||Xi−Xj||−d` \[m].
* **AxisAlign:** angle between `(Xi→Xj)` and target axis \[rad].
* **Plane:** signed distance `n·X + d` \[m].
* **Equality:** `Xi−Xj` \[m].
* **GaugeFix:** hard pins via variable locking (0 residuals).

## Gauge fixing (mandatory in tests & UI)

* Pick `WP0 = (0,0,0)`.
* Align `(WP0→WP1)` with +X and set distance `d` (scale).
* Use `WP2` to define XY plane (+Y direction).

## Under/Over-constraint

* Rank(J) via SVD. If nullspace > 0, list degrees and implicated vars.
* Over-constraint handled by robust losses; highlight outliers.

## Error reporting

* Show:

  * Top-10 constraints by residual.
  * Per-WP RMS reprojection.
  * Per-image RMS.
  * Uncertainty (std dev) per WP.

## File format (`.pgo`)

* Zip:

  * `/project.json` (schema-versioned)
  * `/images/{id}.link` (path or hash) or `/images/{id}.jpg` if embedded
  * `/thumbnails/{id}.jpg`
  * `/exports/*`
* `project.json` keys: `world_points`, `images`, `cameras`, `constraints`, `settings`, `diagnostics`.

# Initial Task Board (Week 1–4)

* [ ] M0 repo/CI/pre-commit.
* [ ] M1 math primitives + tests.
* [ ] M2 models+schemas+registry.
* [ ] M3 SceneGen + synthetic suites.
* [ ] Wire a “two-view box room” golden test; DoF check.

---

# Risk & Mitigation

* **PnP failures on near-planar scenes:** detect planarity; request non-coplanar IPs; fallback global init.
* **Unstable intrinsics:** lock K until multi-view observed; enable k1 only after stable.
* **Fusion 360 camera import limits:** don’t promise cameras; export construction geometry instead.
* **Performance ceiling:** implement Schur step; if insufficient, plan M14: C++ backend (Ceres) bridge (out of scope v0.1).

---

This plan is deliberately explicit. Follow the milestones in order. Block merges unless acceptance criteria pass.
